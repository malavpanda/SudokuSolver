# SudokuSolver with Constraint Propagation Algorithms (AI)

## Introduction

Implementation of Backtracking, Forward Checking, Minimum Remaining Value, Degree Heuristic, and Least Constraining Value algorithms to optimize the speed of the Sudoku Solver with respect to the level of a Sudoku (e.g. 9x9, 12x12, 25x25, etc.)

## Code Samples

mytest.java covers how tokens are used and compute the result and outputs the file
